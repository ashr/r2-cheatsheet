     \Large{\textbf{Reversing with Radare2}} \\
\end{center}

\section{Starting Radare}
The basic usage is \texttt{radare2} \textit{executable} (on some systems you can
use \texttt{r2} instead of \texttt{radare2}); if you want to run radare2 without
opening any file, you can use \texttt{-{}-} instead of an executable name.

Some command-line options are:

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\texttt{-d} \textit{file} & debug executable \textit{file} \\
	& \emph{Warning:} if there exists a script named \textit{file}\texttt{.r2}, \\
	& then it gets executed after the others rc-files \\
\texttt{-d} \textit{pid} & debug process \textit{pid} \\
\texttt{-A}	& analyze all referenced code (\texttt{aaa} command) \\
\texttt{-R} \textit{profile}\texttt{.rr2} & specifies \texttt{rarun2} profile (same as \\ & \texttt{-e dbg.profile=}\textit{profile}\texttt{.rr2}) \\
\texttt{-w}	& open file in write mode \\
\texttt{-p} \textit{prj} & use project \textit{prj} \\
\texttt{-p} & list projects \\
\texttt{-h} & show help message (\texttt{-hh} the verbose one)
\end{tabular}

Example: \texttt{r2 -dA /bin/ls}

\section{General information}
The command \texttt{?} prints the help. Command names are hierarchically defined; for instance, all \textbf{p}rinting commands start with \texttt{p}. So, to understand what a command does, you can append \texttt{?} to a \emph{prefix} of such a command; e.g., to learn what \texttt{pdf} does, you can first try \texttt{pd?}, then the more general \texttt{p?}.
You can get recursive help with \texttt{?*}; e.g.: \texttt{p?*}

Single-line comments can be entered using \texttt{\#}; e.g. \texttt{s \# where R we?}.

Command \texttt{?} can also be used to evaluate an expression and print its result in various format; e.g. \texttt{? 5 * 8 + 2} (note the space between \texttt{?} and the expression).  There are also some special \texttt{\$}-variables
(list all of them with: \texttt{?\$?}):

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\texttt{\$\$} & current virtual seek \\
\texttt{\$b} & 	block size \\
\end{tabular}

Where an address \textit{addx} is expected, you can provide any expression that evaluates to an address,
e.g. a function name or a register name. In this cheatsheet we sometimes use \textit{fn-name}, instead of \textit{addx}, to emphasize that the argument is supposed to be a function starting address. As default address is (usually?) used the current seek: \texttt{\$\$}.

All commands that:
\begin{itemize}
\item accept an optional size (e.g. \texttt{pd}), use the current block size by default (see: \texttt{b})
\item accept an optional address (e.g., \texttt{pdf}), use the current position by default (see: \texttt{s})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Internal grep-like filtering}
You can filter command output by appending \texttt{\textasciitilde{}}[\texttt{!}]\textit{str}, to display only rows [not] containing string \textit{str}; e.g. \texttt{pdf\textasciitilde{}rdx} and \texttt{pdf\textasciitilde{}!rdx}. You can further filter by appending

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\texttt{:}\textit{r}	& to display row \textit{r} ($0\le r < \#\mathit{rows}$ or, backwards \\ & with: $-\#\mathit{rows}\le r \le -1)$ \\
\texttt{[}$c_1[,c_2,\ldots]$\texttt{]}	& to display columns $c_1,c_2,\ldots$ ($0\le c_i < \#\mathit{cols}$) \\
\texttt{:r[}$c_1,\ldots,c_n$\texttt{]}	& to display columns $c_1,\ldots,c_n$ of row $r$ \\
\texttt{..} & to pipe the output into less-like viewer \\
\texttt{...} & to pipe the output into HUD viewer \\
\end{tabular}

Examples: \texttt{afl\textasciitilde{}[0]}, \texttt{afl\textasciitilde{}malloc[0]}, \texttt{pdf\textasciitilde{}:2} and \texttt{pdf\textasciitilde{}mov:2}

There is much more (sorting, counting, \ldots); see: \texttt{\textasciitilde?}

\subsection{Shell interaction}
Command output can be redirected to a file by appending \texttt{>}\textit{filename}
or piped to an external command with \texttt{|}\textit{progname} [\textit{args}].
Examples: \texttt{afl > all\_functions} and \texttt{afl | wc -l}.

External commands can be run with \texttt{!!}\textit{progname} [\textit{args}].
Note: if a command starts with a single \texttt{!}, the rest of the string is passed to currently loaded IO plugin (only if no plugin can handle the command, it is passed to the shell).

External commands can also be run with \texttt{\#!pipe}, see below in \emph{Python scripting}.

The output of external programs can be used as arguments for internal commands by using back-ticks to enclose the invocation of external commands; e.g. \texttt{pdf `echo 3` @ `echo entry0`}.

\subsection{Radare scripting}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\texttt{.} \textit{filename} & interpret r2 script \textit{filename} \\
\texttt{.!} \textit{command} & interpret output of \textit{command} as r2 commands \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Python scripting (via r2pipe)}
You can script Radare2 with Python, by leveraging \emph{r2pipe}, that can be easily installed (inside any Python 2 virtual environment)
with: \\ \texttt{pip install r2pipe}.

Then, you can spawn a Python interpreter, from inside r2, with: \\
\texttt{\#!pipe python} [\textit{python-file}] \\
or simply: \\
\texttt{\#.} \textit{python-file}

Once you are in Python-world, you can connect to r2 by \texttt{import}ing \texttt{r2pipe} and inizializing some variable,
say \texttt{r2}, with \texttt{r2pipe.open("\#!pipe")}, or simply \texttt{r2pipe.open()}.

Then you can interact with Radare by invoking method \texttt{cmd}; e.g. \texttt{print(r2.cmd('pdf @ entry0'))}.

You can make most Radare2 commands output in JSON format by appending a \texttt{j}; e.g. \texttt{pdfj} (instead of \texttt{pdf}).

Method \texttt{cmdj} can de-serialize JSON output into Python objects; e.g. \texttt{f = r2.cmdj('pdfj @ entry0')} \\ \texttt{print f['name'], f['addr'], f['ops'][0]['opcode']}

\subsubsection{r2pipe: connecting to other r2 instances}
You can connect to any web-listening instance of r2 by passing \texttt{r2pipe.open} a
string of the form \texttt{'http://}\textit{host}\texttt{:}\textit{port}\texttt{'}.
By using this approach you get your own seek-cursor: your seek commands won't affect
others.

To open a background web-service in r2 use command \texttt{=h\&}. You may also want to 
take a look at configuration variable \texttt{http.sandbox}.

\section{Running in different environments: rarun2}
\texttt{rarun2} is used as a launcher for running programs with different environment,
arguments, permissions, directories and overridden default file-descriptors.
Usage:

\texttt{rarun2} [\texttt{-t}$|$\textit{script-name}\texttt{.rr2}] [\textit{directives}] [\texttt{-{}-}] [\textit{prog-name}] [\textit{args}]

\texttt{rarun2 -t} shows the terminal name, say $\alpha$, and wait for a connection from another process. For instance, from another terminal, you can execute \texttt{rarun2 stdio=$\alpha$ program=/bin/sh} (use \texttt{stdin}/\texttt{stdout} to redirect one stream only).

rarun2 supports \emph{a lot} of directives, see the man page.
