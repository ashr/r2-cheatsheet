# r2 cheatsheet

An incomplete/work-in-progress cheatsheet, mainly targeted at reversing binaries,
that I wrote for my own personal use; I hope that others will find it helpful.

Many options/commands have been found out and taught me by [Packmad](https://github.com/packmad); thanks!

Compile the cheatsheet with: pdflatex r2-cheatsheet.tex
